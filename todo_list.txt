IN THIS FILE I'LL ADD THE FEATURES I WANT TO ADD TO THE PROJECT:

Features:
    - Add support for different kinds of rules, not just Conway's Game of Life
    - Add CMD - Commands

Controller:

Eventmanager:

View:
    - UI Buttons to start & stop
    - UI Element to change animation speed
    - UI Element to input rule-format and specific rule

Field, Model:
    - Should neighborhood be coded into rule or field?
    - Update through model rather than field
    - spawn different pattern onto Field through some generalized function
    - Should Model-Updating be an Event for the eventqueue?

QA:
    - Add pydoc comments to everything
    - enable error logging
    - add unit tests for each class
    - Closing game without errors/crashing possible?
